## Overview

The front end of my fullstack app. This app is intended to be a crowd sourced design app centered around tattoos.


I started with designing the database structure and then tried to work out the front end layout from there. I decided to use Ember which am very new too and it led to a few hickups.

This app is still very much a work in progress.

## User Stories

1.  I am a user who wold like to have many tattoo designs for my idea.
2.  I am an artist who would like to make some money designing tattoos.

## Issues
1. Backend validation problems
2. Front end routing issues
